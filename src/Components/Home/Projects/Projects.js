In the face of economic hardship, widespread job loss, and the uncertainty brought on by the lockdown, we distributed essential food items that sustained many. Our efforts included providing staples such as rice, beans, noodles, and garri, etc which offered much-needed relief to those struggling to make ends meet. Our outreach focused on the Ajegunle community, particularly targeting areas like Tolu Roads, JMJ Quarters, Wilmer, and Babatunde Street.
